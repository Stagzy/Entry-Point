## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being patient and understanding with newcomers

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person
- Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct
- Ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful

- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered representation of the project or community

## Reporting
